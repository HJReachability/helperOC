# helperOC
helperOC is an optimal control toolbox for Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis.  All code in this repository is written in MATLAB. There is a corresponding C++ version "Berkeley Efficient API in C++ for Level Set methods" (BEACLS) here: https://hjreachability.github.io/beacls/

## Dependencies
helperOC requires MATLAB, and depends on the Level Set Methods Toolbox by Ian Mitchell (https://bitbucket.org/ian_mitchell/toolboxls).

## Quick-start guide
